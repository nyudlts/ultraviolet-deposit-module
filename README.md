# UltraViolet ðŸ’œ - Deposit module

UltraViolet is NYU Libraries' platform for long-term access to a broad range of NYU-related digital content, 
including open access data associated with research and scholarly output and data licensed for use by members of the NYU community.

to customize some aspect of its functionality.
